# CerberusWAF - AI-Enhanced Web Application Firewall

CerberusWAF is a next-generation Web Application Firewall that combines traditional rule-based security with advanced machine learning to protect web applications from both known and zero-day attacks.

## Features

- Real-time HTTP(S) traffic analysis
- Deep learning-based attack detection (CNN, LSTM, Transformer models)
- Traditional rule-based security policies
- Real-time traffic monitoring and anomaly detection
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring and management
- Scalable deployment with Docker and Kubernetes
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **WAF Engine**: Core middleware for request interception and processing
- **Request Parser**: HTTP request analysis and feature extraction
- **Traffic Monitor**: Real-time traffic analysis and anomaly detection
- **ML Models**: Deep learning models for attack classification
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based dashboard for monitoring and management




## Security

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Automatic updates for ML models
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
